# TestAutomationforX

This repository contains a simple Selenium based automation framework.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

Execute the login test with:

```bash
pytest -v
```

The test opens the login page, enters credentials and fetches the OTP from
Yopmail. Running the tests requires access to download ChromeDriver; if the
environment blocks this download, tests may fail with a connection error.
